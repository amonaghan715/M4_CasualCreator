# Personal Meaning
When I find myself incredibly stressed out or overwhelmed, my go to activity has always been to grab a piece of paper and doodle. I don't draw anything in particular--just lines and shapes and patterns--but it always helps me shut my brain off and relax for a bit. As I was attempting to brainstorm ideas for this project, I found myself overwhelmed by the possibilities and the work that I knew it would take to create a product that I was proud to turn in. I turned to my trusty destressing method, and voila! I had my idea. During reading period in particular, I feel like everyone is so stressed all the time, and I wanted to make a way for everyone to be able to turn off their brains and relax for a bit. Thus, I took my little coping strategy and brought it to life on my computer. I have shared it with/tested it on a few friends already (see the photos included in the repo for shots of the work they were excited to share!), and was able to give them a brief respite from their work and stress with a bit of fun and satisfying drawing. In a way, I feel like the creation of this project has been a kind of casual creator in itself for me: I had tons of fun creating and refining it, I found p5.js to be a smooth experience that gave me immediate feedback, and I am super proud and excited to share what I have created with friends and family (I already sent my family the link).
